# How to write an argument parser with subcommands {#subcommand_arg_parse}

[TOC]

This HowTo shows you how to write an argument parser with subcommand like `git push` using SeqAn.

\tutorial_head{Easy, 15 min, \ref tutorial_argument_parser, }

# Motivation

A common use case for command line tools, e.g. `git`, is to have multiple subcommands, e.g. `git fetch` or `git push`.
Each subcommand has its own set of options and its own help page.
This HowTo explains how this can be done with the seqan3::argument_parser and serves as a copy'n'paste source.
If you are new to SeqAn, we recommend to do the basic
\link tutorial_argument_parser argument parser tutorial \endlink before you read further.

# A subcommand argument parser

In order to keep parsing with subcommands straightforward and simple,
the seqan3::argument_parser provides an advanced interface that internally takes care of the correct input parsing.

You simply need to specify the names of the subcommands when constructing your top-level argument parser:

\snippet doc/howto/subcommand_argument_parser/subcommand_arg_parse.cpp construction

\attention You can still add flags to your top-level parser if needed but **no (positional) options**.
This avoids ambiguous parsing (e.g. subcommand fasta given file extension fasta
`./myfasta_parser --filext fasta fasta ...`).

After calling seqan3::argument_parser::parse() on your top-level parser,
you can then access the sub-parser via the function seqan3::argument_parser::get_sub_parser():

\snippet doc/howto/subcommand_argument_parser/subcommand_arg_parse.cpp get_sub_parser

The sub-parser's **seqan3::argument_parser::info::app_name will be set to the user chosen sub command**.
For example, if the user calls

```
max$ ./mygit push -h
```

then the sub-parser will be named `mygit-push` and will be instantiated with all arguments
followed by the keyword `push` which in this case triggers printing the help page (`-h`).

That's it. Here is a full example of a subcommand argument parser you can try and adjust to your needs:
