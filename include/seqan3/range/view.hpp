/*!\defgroup view View
 * \brief Views are "lazy range combinators" that offer modified views onto other ranges.
 * \ingroup range
 * \sa https://ericniebler.github.io/range-v3/index.html#range-views
 * \sa range/view.hpp
 *
 * SeqAn3 makes heavy use of views as defined in the
 * [Ranges Technical Specification](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/experimental/ranges). Currently the
 * implementation is based on the [range-v3 library](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) and all those views
 * are available in the namespace ranges::view, see
 * [the overview](https://ericniebler.github.io/range-v3/index.html#range-views) for more details.
 *
 * This submodule provides additional views, specifically for operations on biological data and
 * sequence analysis.
 *
 * \attention
 * To prevent naming conflicts, all SeqAn views are inside the namespace seqan3::view.
 *
 * \par Example
 *
 * ```cpp
 * dna4_vector vec{"ACGGTC"_dna4};
 * auto vec_view  = vec | view::complement;                         // == "TGCCAG" (but doesn't own any data)
 * auto vec_view2 = vec | ranges::view::reverse;                    // == "CTGGCA" (but doesn't own any data)
 *
 * // or in one line:
 * auto vec_view3 = vec | view::complement | ranges::view::reverse; // == "GACCGT" (but doesn't own any data)
 * ```
 */

/*!
 * \namespace seqan3::view
 * \brief The SeqAn3 namespace for views.
 *
 * Since views often have name clashes with regular functions and ranges they are implemented in the sub
 * namespace `view`.
 *
 * See the \link view view submodule \endlink of the range module for more details.
