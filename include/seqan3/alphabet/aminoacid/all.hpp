/*!\defgroup aminoacid
 * \brief Contains the amino acid alphabets and functionality for translation from nucleotide.
 * \ingroup alphabet
 *
 * \par Introduction
 * Amino acid sequences are an important part of bioinformatic data processing and used by many applications
 * and while it is possible to represent them in a regular std::string, it makes sense to have specialised data
 * structures in most cases. This sub-module offers the 27 letter aminoacid alphabet as well as a reduced version
 * that can be used with regular container and ranges.
 * The 27 letter amino acid alphabet contains the 20 canonical amino acids, 2 additional proteinogenic amino acids
 * (Pyrrolysine and Selenocysteine) and a termination letter (*). Additionally 4 wildcard letters are offered which
 * allow a more generic usage for example in case of ambiguous amino acids (e.g. J which means either Isoleucine or
 * Leucine). See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid for more information about the amino acid alphabet.

 * |   *      | Terminator      |
 * |   X      | any aminoacid   |
 *
 * While the proteinogenic amino acid alphabet consists of 22 amino acids, there are more characters defined
 * which offer a certain ambiguity.
