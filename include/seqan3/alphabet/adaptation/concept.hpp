 * \ingroup adaptation
 *
 * \details
 * This concept introduces no formal requirements beyond those of seqan3::alphabet_concept
 * and type being one of the following types:
 *
 *   * `char`
 *   * `char16_t`
 *   * `char32_t`
 *
 * \attention
 *   * Note that `signed char` and `unsigned char` are absent from the list, because of
 * their type ambiguity with `int8_t` and `uint8_t`.
 *   * Note that `wchar_t` is absent from the list for its notorious brokenness (different sizes and signedness
 * between platforms); use `char16_t` or `char32_t` instead.
 *
 * \attention
 * Please be aware that this file needs be included **after** `alphabet/adaptation/char.hpp`.
 *
 * \par Concepts and doxygen
 * The requirements for this concept are given as related functions and metafunctions.
 * Types that satisfy this concept are shown as "implementing this interface".
