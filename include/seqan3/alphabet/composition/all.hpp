 * \brief Provides data structures joining multiple alphabets into a single alphabet.
 * \ingroup alphabet
 *
 * \par Introduction
 *
 * Composition alphabets are special alphabets that allow you to combine existing alphabets into new ones. For example,
 * you can add new characters to existing alphabets by using seqan3::union_composition or combine alphabets with quality
 * information by using seqan3::cartesian_composition.
 *
 * We have currently two major composition alphabets:
 * * seqan3::cartesian_composition which roughly corresponds to the Cartesian product of the given types. It
 *   behaves similar to std::tuple, but it is specialised for alphabets.
 * * seqan3::union_composition which roughly corresponds to the Union of the given types. It behaves similar to
 *   std::variant, but it is specialised for alphabets.
