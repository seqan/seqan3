/*!\brief A single-use synchronisation point to coordinate concurrent threads.
 * \ingroup parallel
 *
 * \details
 *
 * A latch is a thread coordination mechanism that allows any number of threads to block until an expected
 * count is summed (exactly) by threads that arrived at the latch. The expected count is set when the latch is
 * constructed. An individual latch is a single-use object; once the count has been reached, the latch cannot be reused.
 * This implementation uses a lock-free mechanism if the atomic operations on the respective platform are lock-free.
 *
 * \note This adapts the proposal for the c++ standard
 * [P0666R2](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0666r2.pdf) for latches and is likely to be
 * changed according to the revisions of the proposal.
