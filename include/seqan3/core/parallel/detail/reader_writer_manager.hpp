 *
 *
 * \details
 *
 * A reader writer manager is a thread coordination mechanism specifically designed to synchronise with a concurrent
 * data structure such as the seqan3::detail::buffer_queue. In particular, the manager is constructed with a
 * seqan3::detail::reader_count and a seqan3::detail::writer_count and offers special functions for readers
 * and writers that arrive at the synchronisation point. If all writers arrived at the synchronisation point
 * the associated concurrent data structure is closed by invoking the member method `close()`. This so called
 * completion phase is triggered  by only one of the participating producer threads. Accordingly, no more data can
 * be added to the concurrent data structure and possibly waiting readers on an empty data structure can be released.
 * The destructor of the reader_writer_manager will wait until all readers and writers arrived at the synchronisation
 * point. Thus, a concurrent data structure can be safely destructed after the reader_writer_manager is destructed.
 *
 * The class offers functions to register participating producer and consumer threads, which will signal if they are
 * done when their destructor is called.
 *
 * The reader_writer_manager class is move-only and cannot be default constructed.
