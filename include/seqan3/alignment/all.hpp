/*!\defgroup alignment Alignment
 * \brief The alignment module contains concepts, algorithms and classes that are related to the computation of
 *        pairwise and multiple sequence alignments.
 *
 * \details
 *
 * There are several types of alignments. We support \ref alignment_pairwise "pairwise alignments" so far, but we also
 * plan to support multiple alignments in the future.
 *
 * SeqAn offers a generic multi-purpose alignment library comprising all widely known alignment algorithms as well as
 * many special algorithms. These algorithms are all accessible through an easy to use alignment interface which
 * is described in \ref alignment_pairwise.
