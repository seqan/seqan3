 * \brief A subset of the C++20 standard library made available in pre-C++20 contexts.
 *
 * \details
 *
 * This module provides many parts of the C++20 standard library (and some parts of the C++17 standard library
 * not available in GCC). They are only defined if not found in the compiler's standard library and are called exactly
 * like the originals so they can be used interchangeably.
 *
 * \attention All of this sub-module is subject to change!
 *
 * In particular:
 *
 *   * We do not provide all C++20 library features, only those that are used by SeqAn.
 *   * All of these might change or be removed once C++20 is published.
 *   * The documentation of this module will likely be removed entirely in favour of links to
 *     https://en.cppreference.com
 *
 * It is best you consider every entity in this module as:
 *
 * \noapi
