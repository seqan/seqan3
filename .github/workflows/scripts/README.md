## g++_ram.sh

`VERSION` needs to be replaced with the gcc version. When `DO_TIME` is `0`, this is just a wrapper for gcc that does
nothing additionial. This mode might be necessary for CMake to properly detect ZLIB, etc..
When `DO_TIME` is `1`, every call will generate a `ram_usage.*` file with an unique extension containing the output
of `time -v`.

## gcov.sh

We use `gcovr` to create our coverage reports. We do not want to report branch coverage, but only line coverage.
However, when `gcovr` calls `gcov`, the arguments enabling branch coverage reporting are always added.
`gcov.sh` will remove those arguments and pass the remaining arguments to `gcov`.

## process_compiler_error_log.py

Processes the output of compiling tests (`make`) and extracts errors.
Used in the API Stability and Latest Libraries workflow to create issues containing error messages.

## ram_usage.py

Processes a logfile containing all `time -v` outputs of `g++_ram.sh` and creates a table.
Used in the RAM Usage workflow.

"Command being timed:" occurs every 23 lines.
The compiler is called two times: compiling and linking. Only the measurement for compiling is of interest.
The compile step will contain the path to the source file, e.g, `seqan3/test/unit/argument_parser/format_parse_test.cpp`.
The linking step will not, e.g., `CMakeFiles/format_parse_test.dir/format_parse_test.cpp.o -o format_parse_test`.

Hence, we iterate over all the time outputs (blocks of length 23) and check if there is `unit` in the command.
If yes, this is something we want the RAM usage of (`parsing_ram_usage`). If we want to parse the RAM usage, and we
are on the 9th line after the beginning of a block, we are in the line that contains `Maximum resident set size`.

The output is sorted by the RAM Usage (descending):
```
File,RAM in MiB
unit/search/search_test.cpp,2281
unit/alignment/pairwise/global_affine_unbanded_callback_test.cpp,1982
unit/search/search_collection_test.cpp,1620

unit/alignment/pairwise/edit_distance/semi_global_edit_distance_max_errors_unbanded_test.cpp,1363
