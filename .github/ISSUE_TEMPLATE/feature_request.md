<!--
Thank you for requesting a feature! Please note that we have limited resources and won't be able to
implement everything that we (or you) would like.

One of the following will happen to feature requests:

  * We will "accept" it and someone will start working on it for the next release.
  * We will convert it to a card in our [long-term project planning](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/projects), but
    close the issue for now as no-one can work on it immediately. You are welcome to contribute patches yourself,
    see the [contributor guide](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/CONTRIBUTING.md).
  * The feature request is invalid and will be closed.
-->
