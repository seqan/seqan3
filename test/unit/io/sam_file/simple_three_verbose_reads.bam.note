This BAM File is special crafted as it consists of 5 BGZF blocks

1. Block is the BAM-Header
2. Block is read1
3. Block is read2
4. Block is read3
5. Block is a special EOF-Block (see also 4.1.2 End-of-file marker, SAM specification)

### File creation

Create 3 BAM files for each read

```bash
sed -n '1,2p;3p' simple_three_verbose_reads.sam | samtools view --no-PG -bS  > simple_three_verbose_reads.read1.bam
sed -n '1,2p;4p' simple_three_verbose_reads.sam | samtools view --no-PG -bS  > simple_three_verbose_reads.read2.bam
sed -n '1,2p;5p' simple_three_verbose_reads.sam | samtools view --no-PG -bS  > simple_three_verbose_reads.read3.bam
```

each of those files have 3 BGZF Blocks (header, read, EOF).

```bash
samtools view --no-PG -h simple_three_verbose_reads.read1.bam
samtools view --no-PG -h simple_three_verbose_reads.read2.bam
samtools view --no-PG -h simple_three_verbose_reads.read3.bam
```

I wrote a tool bam_bgzf_split that splits each BGZF block in bgzf compressed file.

```bash
./bam_bgzf_split simple_three_verbose_reads.read1.bam
./bam_bgzf_split simple_three_verbose_reads.read2.bam
./bam_bgzf_split simple_three_verbose_reads.read3.bam
```

Concat all BGZF Blocks to one new bam file

```bash
cat simple_three_verbose_reads.read1.bam.000.gz \
    simple_three_verbose_reads.read{1,2,3}.bam.075.gz \
    simple_three_verbose_reads.read1.bam.179.gz > simple_three_verbose_reads.bam

rm simple_three_verbose_reads.read*
```

Double check file

```bash
samtools view --no-PG -h simple_three_verbose_reads.bam
```
