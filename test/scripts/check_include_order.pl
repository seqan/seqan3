# Usage check_include_order.pl <file1> [<file2>] [<file3>] ....
# Will output the names of the files that have incorrect include order.
#
# Usage example: `check_include_order.pl $(git diff --name-only HEAD origin/master)`
# Checks all files that have been touch since last master for any incorrect include ordering
#
# Usage example: `check_include_order.pl $(find include -type f)
# Checks all files of seqan3 for incorrect include ordering
#
# This is a script checking for blocks of include statements:
#
#  #include <cassert>
#  #include <concepts>
#  #include <utility>
#
#  It will extract the include paths to
#     cassert
#     concepts
#     utility
#  and check if they appear in the correct order.
