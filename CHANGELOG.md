<!--
The following API changes should be documented as such:
  * a previously experimental interface now being marked as stable
  * an interface being removed
  * syntactical changes to an interface (e.g. renaming or reordering of files, functions, parameters)
  * semantical changes to an interface (e.g. a function's result is now always one larger) [DANGEROUS!]

If possible, provide tooling that performs the changes, e.g. a shell-script.
-->

# 3.0.2

Note that 3.1.0 will be the first API stable release and interfaces in this release might still change.

## New features

#### Build system

* Add top-level `CMakeLists.txt`
  ([\#1475](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1475)).
* We now use Doxygen version 1.8.17 to build our documentation
  ([\#1500](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1500)).

#### Search

* Added `seqan3::interleaved_bloom_filter`, a data structure that efficiently answers set-membership queries for
  multiple bins ([\#920](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/920)).

## API changes

## Notable Bug-fixes

# 3.0.1

Note that 3.1.0 will be the first API stable release and interfaces in this release might still change.

## New features

#### Alphabet

* Added `seqan3::semialphabet_any`, a semi-alphabet that type erases all other semi-alphabets of the same size
  ([\#981](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/981)).
* Added `seqan3::dna3bs`, an alphabet that mimics a bisulfite-treated dna4 sequence
  ([\#1191](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1191)).

#### Alignment

* The score type used in the alignment score matrix and the result type is configurable through a template
  argument of the `seqan3::align_cfg::result` configuration
  ([\#1340](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1340)).
* The function`seqan3::align_pairwise` can be parallelised using the`seqan3::align_cfg::parallel` configuration
  ([\#1379](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1379),
   [\#1444](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1444)).

#### Argument parser

* Simplified reading file extensions from formatted files with the`seqan3::input_file_validator` and
  `seqan3::output_file_validator`
  ([\#863](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/863)).
* The `seqan3::value_list_validator` is now constructible from a range or a parameter pack
  ([\#1298](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1298)).
* Enable subcommand argument parsing, see [How-to](https://docs.seqan.de/seqan/3.0.1/subcommand_arg_parse.html)
  for an example
  ([\#1185](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1185)).
* The `seqan3::argument_parser::add_option` (and add_positional_option) calls allow enum types when using the
  `seqan3::enumeration_names` customisation point
  ([\#1196](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1196)).

#### Build system

* `find_package(SeqAn3)` is now case-insensitive and always populates `SEQAN3_*` variables in all upper-case
  ([\#1427](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1427)).

#### Core

* Added `seqan3::lzcnt`, `seqan3::tzcnt`, and `seqan3::popcount` for bit manipulation
  ([\#1141](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1141)).
* Added traits for "metaprogramming" with `seqan3::type_list` and type packs
  ([\#1204](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1204),
   [\#1214](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1214),
   [\#1273](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1273)).
* Added SIMD functions `seqan3::upcast` and `seqan3::upcast_signed`
  ([\#1190](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1190)).

#### I/O

* We increased our input performance using a faster iterator on the stream buffer
  ([\#1030](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1030)).
* Support of padded alignments in the SAM/BAM format was added
  ([\#1173](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1173)).
* Reading `seqan3::field::cigar` into a vector over `seqan3::cigar` is supported via
  `seqan3::alignment_file_input`
  ([\#1192](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1192)).
* Writing `seqan3::field::cigar` into a vector over `seqan3::cigar` is supported via
  `seqan3::alignment_file_output`
  ([\#1192](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1192)).
* Asynchronous input (background file reading) supported via `seqan3::view::async_input_buffer`
  ([\#1205](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1205)).

### Range

* Added `seqan3::views::kmer_hash`, a view that computes hash values of an alphabet sequence given a
  `seqan3::shape`
  ([\#946](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/946)).
* Added `seqan3::views::to`, a view that returns a container created from a range by copying all elements
  ([\#1033](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1033)).
* Added `seqan3::dynamic_bitset`, a container that stores single bits and has a dynamic size
  ([\#1153](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1153)).
* Added `seqan3::views::translate_join`, analogue to `seqan3::views::translate` but returns a flattened range
  ([\#1171](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1171)).
* Added `seqan3::views::to_simd`, a view that transforms a range of ranges into chunks of `seqan3::simd` vectors
  ([\#1190](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1190)).
* Added `seqan3::views::as_const`, a view that provides only `const &` to elements of the underlying range
  ([\#1410](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1410)).
* Added `seqan3::views::move`, a view that turns lvalue-references into rvalue-references
  ([\#1410](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1410)).
* Renamed `seqan3::views::all` to `seqan3::views::type_reduce`
  ([\#1410](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1410)).

#### Search

* The memory footprint of FM-indices over text collections was reduced
  ([\#1363](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1363)).

### Std

* We provide a `std::to_chars` overload for floating point data types in our `seqan3/std/from_chars` header
  ([\#1160](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1160)).

## API changes

* The required version of the ranges-v3 library has increased:
  We now support the versions >= 0.10.0 and < 0.11.0, increasing the previous requirement of >= 0.5.0 and < 0.6.0
  ([\#1471](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1471)).
* Customising for third party types has changes slightly:
  You are only affected if you added types to `seqan3::custom::`.
  Please see [About Customisation](http://docs.seqan.de/seqan/3.0.1/about_customisation.html)
  ([\#1225](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1225)).
* All our concepts are named in the `snake_case` style
  (e.g. `seqan3::WritableAlphabet` -> `seqan3::writable_alphabet`)! This change was motivated by the decision of the
  ISO C++ committee to also use snake case everywhere
  ([\#1235](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1235)).

#### Alphabet

* The `seqan3::cigar` alphabet is not an `seqan3::alphabet` anymore but only a `seqan3::semialphabet`
  ([\#1285](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1285)).

#### Argument parser

* The `seqan3::value_list_validator` is not constructible from a std::initialiser_list any more
  (e.g. `seqan3::value_list_validator{{1,2,3}}` does not work, use `seqan3::value_list_validator{1,2,3}` instead)
  ([\#1298](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1298)).
* Changed class signature of input/output file validators:
  Most user code will be unaffected; to fix possible compiler errors you need to add an empty template parameter list to
  the respective instances (e.g. change `input_file_validator` to `input_file_validator<>`)
  ([\#863](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/863)).
* The member type that denotes which arguments a `validator` can validate has been renamed from `value_type` to
  `option_value_type`
  ([\#1394](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1394)).
* Some exception names were altered and some removed ([\#1394](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1467)):
  * The exception seqan3::parser_invalid_argument was renamed to seqan3::argument_parser_error.
  * The exception seqan3::validation_failed was renamed to seqan3::validation_error.
  * The exception seqan3::parser_design_error was renamed to seqan3::design_error and also inherits from
    seqan3::argument_parser_error.
  * The exception seqan3::type_conversion_failed was deprecated, you can catch seqan3::user_input_error instead.
  * The exception seqan3::overflow_error_on_conversion was deprecated, you can catch seqan3::user_input_error instead.

#### Build system

* [find_package](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/find_package.html#version-selection) accepts minimum
  versions (e.g. `find_package(SEQAN3 3.0.1)` requires at least SeqAn3 with a version of `>= 3.0.1` and `< 4.0.0`)
  ([\#1425](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1425)).
* The variable `SEQAN3_VERSION_STRING` defined by `find_package(SEQAN3)` was renamed to `SEQAN3_VERSION`
  ([\#1425](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1425)).

#### Core

* The `type_list` header has moved:
  If you included `<seqan3/core/type_list.hpp>` you need to change the path to `<seqan3/core/type_list/type_list.hpp>`
  ([\#1204](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1204)).

#### I/O

* Removed the field-based in- and output interface for sequence and structure files through std::get and std::tie:
  Output can instead be achieved with `seqan3::views:zip()`, for input we will implement `unzip()` in the future
  ([\#1398](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1398)
  [\#1412](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1412)).
* The `seqan3::field::flag` of SAM/BAM input and output is now an enum instead of an integer, see `seqan3::sam_flag`
  ([\#1390](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1390)).
* Uppercase `seqan3::field` names are deprecated. Use the lower case field names instead. You can easily find
  and replace all occurrences by the following regex: find `field::([A-Z_]+)` replace `field::\L$1`
  ([\#1421](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1421)).

* Removed the char type from the input and output files:
  Most user code will be unaffected; however, if you have fully specified all templates of any of the input or output
  files in your code, you need to remove the template parameter to select the char type of the stream,
  e.g. change `seqan3::sequence_file_input<traits_t, fields_t, formats_t, char>` to
  `seqan3::sequence_file_input<traits_t, fields_t, formats_t>`. Before this change, setting the char type gave the
  impression that also streams over wide characters are supported which is not the case yet
  ([\#1400](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1400)).

#### Range

* The `seqan3::concatenated_sequences::data()` function has been deprecated:
  Use `seqan3::concatenated_sequences::raw_data()` instead
  ([\#1208](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1208)).
* `seqan3::to_char` must always return a built-in character type
  ([\#1285](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1285)).
* `seqan3/range/view` has be renamed to `seqan3/range/views`
  ([\#1251](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1251)).
* namespace `seqan3::view` has been renamed to `seqan3::views`
  ([\#1251](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1251)).

#### Search

* Changed class signature of (bi_)fm_index:
  All code that relies on automatic template deduction will be unaffected. In case you specified the template parameters
  of a `seqan3::fm_index` or `seqan3::bi_fm_index` you will need to add the alphabet type as first parameter and pass a
  `seqan3::text_layout` instead of a `bool` to indicate the text layout (single, collection).
  For example, `fm_index<false> index{text}` where `text` is of type `dna4_vector` needs to be changed to
  `fm_index<dna4, text_layout::single> index{text}`
  ([\#1222](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1222)).

* The `construct()` method of the (bi_)fm_index is now private:
  Use the constructor `seqan3::fm_index::fm_index(text_t && text)` or `seqan3::bi_fm_index::bi_fm_index(text_t && text)`
  instead
  ([\#1222](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1222)).

* The `seqan3::fm_index::char_type` member was renamed to `seqan3::fm_index::alphabet_type`
  The same applies for the `seqan3::bi_fm_index`
  ([\#1433](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1433)).

* The `seqan3::fm_index_cursor::index_char_type` member was renamed to
  `seqan3::fm_index_cursor::index_alphabet_type`
  The same applies for the `seqan3::bi_fm_index_cursor`
  ([\#1433](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1433)).

## Notable Bug-fixes

* All our headers are self contained
  ([\#1085](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1085)).
* The alignment algorithm with edit distance returns the correct back coordinate
  ([\#1093](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1093)).
* Inserting or deleting gaps into an empty `seqan3::gap_decorator` does not cause assert anymore
  ([\#1109](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1109)).
* Some fixes to edge cases in BAM file writing
  ([\#1110](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1110)).
* The application name of the `seqan3::argument_parser` is restricted to alpha-numeric characters and `_` and `-`
  ([\#1133](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1133)).
* Copying and moving the `seqan3::fm_index` and `seqan3::bi_fm_index` now work properly
  ([\#1144](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1144)).
* Searching in the `seqan3::fm_index` and `seqan3::bi_fm_index` constructed from a text collection containing a
  single text now returns the correct result
  ([\#1316](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1316)).
* The view `seqan3::views::take` is sized if the underlying range is sized
  ([\#1146](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1146)).
* The detection of the pthread library works correctly on linux based systems
  ([\#1200](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1200)).
* The translation table for nucleotide to amino acid translation was corrected
  ([\#1485](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1485)).
* The amino acid score matrices were corrected
  ([\#1455](https://github.com/seqan/seqan3/pull/1455)).

# 3.0.0 ("Escala")

This is the initial release of SeqAn3.
It is an entirely new library so there is no changelog that covers the differences to SeqAn2.

Note that 3.1.0 will be the first API stable release and interfaces in this release might still change.
